# Car-Seatbelt-3D-Plot
UVA's Center for Applied Biomechanics conducted a test series studying the interaction of a car occupant's lap seatbelt with the occupant's Pelvis (July-October 2023).

During this test series, several streams of data were collected: <br>
  1. Vicon Motion Tracking marker data
  2. Romer Arm Coordinate Measuring Machine measurements
  3. CT Scan of occupants Pelvis (imported as an .stl file)

This script merges all the data into one 3D view so that the exact angle, position, and shape of the lapbelt relative to the occupant's body can be studied. This data is then being used to develop novel lapbelt use techniques.
